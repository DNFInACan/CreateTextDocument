# CreateTextDocument
A Spigot Plugin made for an April Fool's joke where anybody in the server can make a text document into a certain location.
## Usage
To set your own path, go to CreateTextDocument/src/com/dev_1/CreateTextDocument/CommandHandler/CommandHandler.java and then add your path to line 17.

You must use the 1.16.5 Spigot API as your dependencies, you can find it [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/org/spigotmc/spigot-api/1.16.5-R0.1-SNAPSHOT/) You should try to download the one that only ends in .jar.
